### Future FRONT-END developer

#### About me

I like computer games as a kid, and I heard computers are a good career too,so I went to university close to computer science.
I have higher education in the field of radio electronics.
I've worked in system administration about 8 years.I like the challenge of it,and working close to the hardware. I do my best work in very complicated systems,
because I’m good at keeping track of many details and making few mistakes.I have excellent interpersonal communication skills and that helps me to get on with different people.I’m looking for a chance to take the next step in my career.My goal is to improve my personal and professional skills.
